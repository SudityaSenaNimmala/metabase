2. Take each screenshot as described above
3. Save them to `c:\Users\SudityaNimmala\Desktop\metabase-1\screenshots\` with the exact filenames

5. Test by opening USER_GUIDE.html in a browser to verify all images appear

## Tips for Good Screenshots:

- Use full browser width (maximize window)
- Ensure all text is readable
- Capture in good lighting (if taking photo of screen, better to use screenshot tool)
- For card flip animations, wait for animation to complete
- Make sure tooltips are NOT showing (don't hover while taking screenshot)

After you've taken all screenshots, I'll update the USER_GUIDE.html to reference them in the correct locations.
